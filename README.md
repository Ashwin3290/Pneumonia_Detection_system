# Pneumonia Detection system


Introduction
---
Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under five years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5.

Using this as my problem statement I have made this Pnuemonia detection system.This uses image classification to predict whether a patient has pneumonia based on the chest x-ray of the given patient. 

The project is made with [Customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) made by **TomSchimansky** for the interface and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for model training.

Steps to run
---
[Model.ipynb](Model.ipynb) can be executed on 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) as well as Jupyter notebook, but Colab is recommended with GPU run time.

Run the [Package_installer.bat](Package_installer.bat) to install all the packages needed.
Unzip the saved_model.zip and then run [Interface.py](Interface.py).

Check out the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
